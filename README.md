config
========================

Mainly dot files like .vimrc, .zshrc .gitconfig.
The repo includes KeyRemap4Macbook and daily Rakefile.


## private.xml

copy private.xml to

``````````````
/Users/hash/Library/Application\ Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml
``````````````

It's bothering, but KeyRemap4Macbook doesn't recognize symbolic link.
