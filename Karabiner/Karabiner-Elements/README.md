After Sierra, Karabiner was deprecated and the only app you have to use is Karabiner-Element.

put jsons under `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/` and restart Karabiner-Element, which will allow you to enable key modifications.
JSON files with digits are imported via internet. Other rules are my personal settings.
