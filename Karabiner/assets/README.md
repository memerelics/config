After Sierra, Karabiner was deprecated and the only app you have to use is Karabiner-Element.

Put jsons under:

```
~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/
```

and restart Karabiner-Element, which will allow you to enable key modifications. Symlink these folders would be better.

JSON files with digits are imported via internet. Other rules are my personal settings.

## TODO

* [] Symlink git managed dir to config file under `~/.config/karabiner/`
* [] sometimes Command+m and other Command-keys are invoked after switch language. I'd like to delay it.
